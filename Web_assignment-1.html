            Hayao Miyazaki is a japanese animator, director, author and artist. He started out as an assistant artist and went on to direct
            his first film in the year 1979. He founded the world renowned animation studio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">
            Studio Ghibli</a> which is noted for its distinct art style. Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as 
            humanity's relationship with nature and technology,the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art 
            and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls 
            or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. His work has influenced 
            the overall perspective of animation through out the world.
